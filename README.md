# Code Gatekeeper

Code Gatekeeper is a conversational AI platform that transforms how developers learn and retain understanding of AI-generated code—addressing the critical **"AI Paradox"** where increased code production leads to decreased comprehension and critical thinking skills.

## 🚀 Core Functionality & Working Prototype

Our fully functional prototype features two sophisticated ElevenLabs Conversational Agents:

### **1. Voice Quiz Agent**
Acts as a “code gatekeeper” that verbally quizzes developers on AI-generated code before allowing approval.  
It asks probing questions about:
- Logic  
- Edge cases  
- Implementation details  

### **2. Voice Tutor Agent**
Provides personalized, topic-specific voice lectures on code concepts, adapting explanations based on the submitted code context.

## 🧠 Technical Complexity & Multimodal Orchestration

- **ElevenLabs Conversational AI** — Real‑time voice‑to‑voice interaction with dynamic prompt injection  
- **Claude AI (Anthropic)** — Intelligent code analysis, question generation, and educational content creation  
- **Clerk Authentication** — Secure user management and session handling  
- **React + TypeScript** — Modern, type‑safe frontend architecture  
- **Dynamic Prompt Engineering** — Runtime context injection for personalized agent behavior

## 💡 Innovation & Creativity

Unlike traditional code review tools, Code Gatekeeper uses **voice-based Socratic dialogue** to ensure developers genuinely understand code before shipping.

This groundbreaking approach:

- Forces **active recall** through verbal explanation  
- Creates **accountability** in AI-assisted development  
- Preserves **human critical thinking** skills in the age of AI

## 🌍 Real-World Impact

Addressing a **$50B+ problem** in enterprise software: technical debt from poorly understood code.

Scalable to:

- Engineering teams requiring code comprehension gates  
- Educational institutions teaching programming  
- Bootcamps ensuring genuine skill development  
- Enterprise compliance environments requiring code understanding audits

## 🎤 Theme Alignment

Code Gatekeeper **exemplifies conversational agents** by unifying voice, browser, and AI APIs into a cohesive autonomous assistant that listens, reasons, responds, and evolves—perfectly embodying the hackathon mission to:

> **“Build something that talks back.”**
